    <h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>
    <h2>Text Formatting</h2>
    <p>
      A paragraph with <em>some words that are emphasized</em> and
      <b>some important words</b>. Followed by some
      <mark>highlighted words</mark>. Feel free to add any other text formatting
      that appeals to you.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px">
      This is some text <br />
      that is laid out exactly as <br />
      Laid out at code level without any additional <br />
      markup <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Special Characters</h2>
    <p>
      The browser thinks &lt is a programming character. Also &gt. The browser
      ignores any line breaks <br />
      in your code and any &nbsp white space. To include these you need to use
      special characters aka html character entitites. There are other entitites
      available such as Â£ and &.
    </p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
      A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have
      links to separate sites such as
      <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk">Leeds Beckett</a>. Links to other
      pages of the
      <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/clearing/">same site</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <img src="images\tree-736885_1280.jpg" alt="Random Image" />
    <p>
      This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder <br />I hope
      you added an alt attribute to support screen readers <br />
      Why not check what happens if you try to validate you code using the W3C
      Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right
      click on your page and chose inspect or view source you can check your
      code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag.
