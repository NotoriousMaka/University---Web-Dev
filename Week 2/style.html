    <h1>Fundamentals of CSS</h1>
    <h2>Cascading</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: 800">
      Style can be added as an inline element using the style attribute on tags
      as is the case for this paragraph. Here font-weight has been given a
      weight of 800.
    </p>
    <p style="color: green; padding-left: 25px; margin-right: 650px">
      The inline style takes precedent over all the otherstyle declarations.
      Next in order of precedent is the embeded style. This uses style tags and
      is often found in the header section of a page. This pre tag is styled
      with embedded style. An extra large green font.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
      Ideally, style is held separately from structure in a style sheet. Other
      than the 2 examples above all other style on this page is in a separate
      style sheet. Including change of base font of Arial.
    </p>
    <h2 id="selecTitle">Selectors</h2>
    <p>
      CSS selectors are used to apply style. There is the element selector,
      class selector and ID selector. All being well you have used an element
      selector to modify the font on this page by adding style to the body tag
      in you attacked sheet. Words in this
      <span class="sentence">sentence</span> have been
      <span class="styled">styled</span> using a class selector applied to
      letter spacing and the heading for this section with an ID selector.
    </p>
    <h2>Box Model</h2>

      https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp</a
    >

    <p>
      The links above are held in a list that is re-styled to remove
      list-style-type and display inline. Padding, margin and border are then
      added as appropriate.
    </p>
    <h2>Layout</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <p>These words are in column 1.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>These words are in column 2.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>These words are in column 3.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Margin, padding, borders and floats added to achieve this layout of
      columns.
    </p>
